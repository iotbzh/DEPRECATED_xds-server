`xds-server` is a web server that allows user to remotely cross build applications.

The first goal is to provide a multi-platform cross development tool with
near-zero installation.
The second goal is to keep application sources locally (on user's machine) to
make it compatible with existing IT policies (e.g. corporate backup or SCM),
and let user to continue to work as usual (use his favorite editor,
keep performance while editing/browsing sources).
